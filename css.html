<dt><h2><u>What is CSS:</u></h2></dt>

<dd> <p><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to 
simplify the process of making web pages presentable. </p>
	<p>CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the 
color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized 
and laid out, what background images or colors are used, as well as a variety of other effects.</p>
	<p>CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides a powerful control over the 
presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup 
languages HTML or XHTML. </p></dd>

<dt><h3><u>History of CSS:</u></h3></dt>

<dd>
<p>CSS was first proposed by <b>Hakon Wium Lie</b> on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was 
working with<br> <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> (father of Html) at CERN. <br>
The European Organization for 
Nuclear Research is known as CERN. Hakon wium lie is known as father of CSS.</p>
	<p> CSS was proposed in 1994 as a web styling language, to solve some of the problems 
of Html 4.<br>
 There were other styling languages proposed at this time, such as Style Sheets 
for Html and JSSS but CSS won.</p>

<dt><h3><u>Versions of CSS:</u></h3></dt>

<dd>
<p>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a separate language with its own syntax, which is 
enable you to lay out web pages exactly as you want them. As HTML grew, it came to 
encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web programmers. 
By the end of 1996, Cascading Style Sheets was ready to become official, and the CSS level 
1 Recommendation was published in December, which is considered as first version of CSS. 
Each level of CSS builds upon the last, typically adding new features and typically denoted 
as CSS level 1, CSS level 2, CSS level 3, and CSS level.<p>
	<P><b>CSS Level 1 (CSS1)</b> was officially released in 1996, and included properties for 
adding font properties such as typeface and emphasis color of text, backgrounds, and other 
elements Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text. 
Unfortunately, lack of dependable web browser support prevented the popularity of CSS 
Level 1 for several years.</p>
	<p><b>CSS level 2 (CSS2)</b> specification was developed by the W3C and published as a 
recommendation in 1998. Its most notably added properties for positioning that allowed CSS 
to be used for page layout. It also introduced styles for other media types and more 
sophisticated methods for selecting elements for styling.</p>
	<p>The earliest<b> CSS level 3 (CSS3)</b> drafts were published in 1999. CSS3 adds 
presentation-style properties, allowing you to effectively build presentations from Web 
documents. CSS level 3 is divided into several separate documents called modules. Due to 
the modularization, different modules have different stability and statuses.</p>
	<p> There is no single CSS4 specification and there is no standard which named as CSS4. 
But a few level 4 modules exist such as Image Values, Backgrounds & Borders, or Selectors 
etc., which build on the functionality of a preceding level 3 module. The level 4 modules can 
collectively be referred to as CSS level 4. There is only CSS standard, and each module can 
level up independently</p>
	<p><b>On 7 June 2011, the CSS 3 Color Module was published as a W3C 
Recommendation.</b></p>

<li>The main advantage of CSS is that style is applied consistently across variety of sites. One instruction can control several areas which is advantageous.</li> <br>
<li>Web designers needs to use few lines of programming for every page improving site speed.</li> <br>
<li>It is less complex therefore the effort is significantly reduced.</li> <br>
<li>It helps to form spontaneous and consistent changes.</li> <br>
<li>It has the power for re-positioning. It helps us to determine the changes within the position of web elements who are there on the page.</li> <br>

<ol type=1>
<li> CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS 3, result in creating of confusion among web browsers.</li><br>
<li>  There exists a scarcity of security. </li><br>
<li> The programming language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. Different levels of CSS i.e.CSS, CSS2, CSS3 are often quite confusing. </li><br>
<li> Browser compatibility (some styles sheets are supported and some are not).</li><br>
<li> CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera supports CSS as different logic.</li><br>
