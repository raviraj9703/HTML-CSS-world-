<h2 align="center"><u>Basic HTML</u></h2>
<p>HTML means Hypertext Markup Language. In 1960 Ted Nelson introduced Hypertext. HTML is a scripting language which is used to create web pages. If you are thinking of creating your own web pages, you need to know at least basic HTML. These HTML documents are plain text files, user can create these documents using text editor like Notepad or Edit.</p>

<p>HTML is a hypertext Language because it supports font styled text, pictures, graphics and animations and also it provides hyper links that used to browse the Internet easily. Text becomes hypertext with the addition of links that connects other hypertext documents.</p> <br>

<p><b><u>Rules to write HTML Code:</u></b></P>

<ol type="1">


	<li>Every HTML document begins with start tag is <HTML> terminates with an ending tag is </HTML></li>
	<li> HTML documents should be saved with the extension .html or .htm.</li>
	 <li>A tag is made up of left operator(<), a right operator(>) and a tag name between these two operators.</li>
	<li> If you forget to mention the right operator(>) or if you give any space between left operator and tag name browser will not consider it as tag.</li>
	<li> At the same time if browser not understands the tag name it just ignores it, browser won’t generate any errors.</li>
	<li> HTML language is not case sensitive; hence user can write the code in either upper case or lower case. No difference between <HTML> and <html></li>
</ol><br>

                        <h2 align="center"><b><u>  HTML Document Creation</u></b></h2>

<p>To create a HTML document we need a text editor to create a file with the extension .html (or) .htm.  Once we have constructed a file and saved it, we have to change the file permissions as “World readable” and “World executable”, so that other people on the web can access the document.</p><br>

<b>Creation of HTML:</b><br>

The Following steps are needed to create a HTML page<br>

<b>Step 1: </b>Open any text editor like Notepad, Edit, Word etc.<br>
